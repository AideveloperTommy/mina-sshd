/**
 * Version and command enumeration.
 * <p>
 * The 13th byte is the protocol version and command. The highest four bits contains the version. As of this
 * specification, it must always be sent as \x2 and the receiver must only accept this value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The lowest four bits represents the command : - \x0 : LOCAL : the connection was established on purpose by the proxy
 * without being relayed. The connection endpoints are the sender and the receiver. Such connections exist when the
 * proxy sends health-checks to the server. The receiver must accept this connection as valid and must use the real
 * connection endpoints and discard the protocol block including the family which is ignored. - \x1 : PROXY : the
 * connection was established on behalf of another node, and reflects the original connection endpoints. The receiver
 * must then use the information provided in the protocol block to get original the address. - other values are
 * unassigned and must not be emitted by senders. Receivers must drop connections presenting unexpected values here.
 * </p>
