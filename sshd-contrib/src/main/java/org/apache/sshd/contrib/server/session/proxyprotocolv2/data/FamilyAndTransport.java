/**
 * Family and Transport Enumeration.
 * <p>
 * The 14th byte contains the transport protocol and address family. The highest 4 bits contain the address family, the
 * lowest 4 bits contain the protocol.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The address family maps to the original socket family without necessarily matching the values internally used by the
 * system. It may be one of : - 0x0 : AF_UNSPEC : the connection is forwarded for an unknown, unspecified or unsupported
 * protocol. The sender should use this family when sending LOCAL commands or when dealing with unsupported protocol
 * families. The receiver is free to accept the connection anyway and use the real endpoint addresses or to reject it.
 * The receiver should ignore address information. - 0x1 : AF_INET : the forwarded connection uses the AF_INET address
 * family (IPv4). The addresses are exactly 4 bytes each in network byte order, followed by transport protocol
 * information (typically ports). - 0x2 : AF_INET6 : the forwarded connection uses the AF_INET6 address family (IPv6).
 * The addresses are exactly 16 bytes each in network byte order, followed by transport protocol information (typically
 * ports). - 0x3 : AF_UNIX : the forwarded connection uses the AF_UNIX address family (UNIX). The addresses are exactly
 * 108 bytes each. - other values are unspecified and must not be emitted in version 2 of this protocol and must be
 * rejected as invalid by receivers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The transport protocol is specified in the lowest 4 bits of the 14th byte : - 0x0 : UNSPEC : the connection is
 * forwarded for an unknown, unspecified or unsupported protocol. The sender should use this family when sending LOCAL
 * commands or when dealing with unsupported protocol families. The receiver is free to accept the connection anyway and
 * use the real endpoint addresses or to reject it. The receiver should ignore address information. - 0x1 : STREAM : the
 * forwarded connection uses a SOCK_STREAM protocol (eg: TCP or UNIX_STREAM). When used with AF_INET/AF_INET6 (TCP), the
 * addresses are followed by the source and destination ports represented on 2 bytes each in network byte order. - 0x2 :
 * DGRAM : the forwarded connection uses a SOCK_DGRAM protocol (eg: UDP or UNIX_DGRAM). When used with AF_INET/AF_INET6
 * (UDP), the addresses are followed by the source and destination ports represented on 2 bytes each in network byte
 * order. - other values are unspecified and must not be emitted in version 2 of this protocol and must be rejected as
 * invalid by receivers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In practice, the following protocol bytes are expected : - \x00 : UNSPEC : the connection is forwarded for an
 * unknown, unspecified or unsupported protocol. The sender should use this family when sending LOCAL commands or when
 * dealing with unsupported protocol families. When used with a LOCAL command, the receiver must accept the connection
 * and ignore any address information. For other commands, the receiver is free to accept the connection anyway and use
 * the real endpoints addresses or to reject the connection. The receiver should ignore address information. - \x11 :
 * TCP over IPv4 : the forwarded connection uses TCP over the AF_INET protocol family. Address length is 2*4 + 2*2 = 12
 * bytes. - \x12 : UDP over IPv4 : the forwarded connection uses UDP over the AF_INET protocol family. Address length is
 * 2*4 + 2*2 = 12 bytes. - \x21 : TCP over IPv6 : the forwarded connection uses TCP over the AF_INET6 protocol family.
 * Address length is 2*16 + 2*2 = 36 bytes. - \x22 : UDP over IPv6 : the forwarded connection uses UDP over the AF_INET6
 * protocol family. Address length is 2*16 + 2*2 = 36 bytes. - \x31 : UNIX stream : the forwarded connection uses
 * SOCK_STREAM over the AF_UNIX protocol family. Address length is 2*108 = 216 bytes. - \x32 : UNIX datagram : the
 * forwarded connection uses SOCK_DGRAM over the AF_UNIX protocol family. Address length is 2*108 = 216 bytes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Only the UNSPEC protocol byte (\x00) is mandatory to implement on the receiver. A receiver is not required to
 * implement other ones, provided that it automatically falls back to the UNSPEC mode for the valid combinations above
 * that it does not support.
 * </p>
